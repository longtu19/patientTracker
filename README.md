# Patient Tracker App
Welcome to our Patient Tracker App.

To run the frontend, execute these commands in the frontend folder:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

To run the server/backend, install all the required libraries in `requirements.txt` and execute `app.py`



When you run the app, you'll be greeted by the Landing page. From then on, you may register as
a patient or a doctor, or login with available credentials.

As a patient, you will be able to view your personal information, make an appointment, and upload your medical record.

As a doctor, you will be able to view all of your patients' information along with a list of your upcoming appointments with them.
